# libasm
### Libasm 42 project
A basic project to familiarize ourselves with the beautiful (and painful)world of assembly language (will be helpful later)

----------------------

### Usage

You can compile the library with a simple `make`
It will create a `libasm.a` file which contains the following functions
- `ft_read`
- `ft_write`
- `ft_strlen`
- `ft_strcmp`
- `ft_strcpy`
- `ft_strdup`

You can also use `make test` to link the library with the [test.c](test.c) to test the previously listed functions.
